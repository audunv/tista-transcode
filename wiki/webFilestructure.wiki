==== .htaccess ====
Used to rewrite URL's. Parameters are sent as `/par1`, eg. `/view/4863`. In this example, the site for viewing a video is requested, with video ID 4863. This makes the URI less confusing and more clean.

This file defines all common PHP classes, variables and functions. MER OM VIKTIGE VARIABLER

==== events/upload-subs-post.php ====
